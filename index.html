                    I graduated from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor of Psychology. I have been working
                    as a
                    Human Resource generalist with experience managing global team and help multi-million-dollar company
                    to
                    grow. I have experience with full-cycle recruiting (phone screen, in-person interview, onboarding,
                    and
                    orientation), employee performance review, investigation, and labor laws. I consider myself a
                    ‘forever
                    student,’ because I’m always trying to learn about the latest labor laws and subjects that will
                    improve me
                    as a person.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m currently enrolled in the UW bootcamp course because I want to my on to a new career. I picked
                    web
                    development because it’s something that will encourage constant learning due to how fast technology
                    changes.
                    Programing also requires problem solving and thinking outside the box. I really like that aspect of
                    programing. Moreover, I also enjoy working as a team to complete a project.

                    Some interesting facts about me is that I can speak three languages: Cantonese, Mandarin and
                    English. I
                    enjoy playing many different types of sports. I played soccer, baseball, football, basketball, track
                    and
                    volleyball during high school and middle school. I also enjoy playing video games. I only play
                    computer
                    games and my favorite games are: League of Legends, Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, and Maple Story. I
                    also
                    stream on Twitch on the side for fun.
